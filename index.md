## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), specializing in deep learning for distributed robotic systems. Really fortunate to be part of [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Lab](https://www.marmotlab.org/), under the supervision of [Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sartoretti-guillaume-a/) and [Prof. Marcelo Ang](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/ang-jr-marcelo-h/). Happy to chat more about anything related to AI or robotics!
